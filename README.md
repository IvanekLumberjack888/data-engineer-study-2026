## 📖 About This Repository

This is a **public learning journey** documenting my path to becoming a Microsoft Fabric Data Engineer. I'm using the **PARA method** (Projects, Areas, Resources, Archive) combined with **gamification** (XP system, quests, boss battles) to stay motivated through 50 consecutive days of study.

**Why public?**
- **Accountability:** Daily commits = visible progress
- **Portfolio:** Showcase dedication to future employers
- **Community:** Help others following the same path
